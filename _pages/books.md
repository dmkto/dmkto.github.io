Dewan Mukto has self-published several novels since 2016 via the means of online platforms like [Wattpad](https://wattpad.com/user/d1stil), [Inkitt](https://inkitt.com/dewanmukto), [Webnovel](https://www.webnovel.com/profile/4322246237), etc.

But the passion for writing stories and novels stretch a long rope of origin back as early as 2007 when he penned fanfiction based on cartoon characters from TV shows such as *Spongebob Squarepants*. Then from 2014 onwards, video games such as *Miami Vice*, *Max Payne 2*, *Grand Theft Auto IV*, and *Battlefield 3* played a major role in inspiring their thematic essence directly and indirectly into the literary craftsmanship for his upcoming novel-length stories. Of which, MIW New Dawn (later renamed as Action Heroes) and Cooper Black are the most notorious for having siphoned ideas from the games Dewan had played.

Nonetheless, here follows a chronological collection of books and works, both published and unpublished, that Mukto has conjured into reality so far:

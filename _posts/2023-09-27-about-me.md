I am an innovative and creative fellow who loves to work and to demonstrate my skills and talents over a wide range of industries and sectors. I often formulate novel concepts to aid in my objectives. From 2015 onward, I founded several projects, began building websites, designing brands, and was involved in leading team members and training them. I learned 𝗼𝗻𝗲 crucial lesson from my experiences :

Despite the fact that I was born and raised in Sylhet, Bangladesh, I managed to maintain a global presence thanks to websites and social platforms. Even to this day, I routinely contribute to the fields of art, music, literature, science and technology. It seems that in the current stage of society and in this global technical era, without websites we have 𝗻𝗼 established existence and without a brand identity we have 𝗻𝗼 individuality.

Empowered by the goal of self-development, I am eager to try out new activities, no matter how great or small. Equally, I welcome changes and I am dynamic enough to calibrate with any rules provided with utmost discipline. My clients and colleagues may often chant "With Dewan Mukto by your side, your project or business is sure to thrive!" when asked about me.
